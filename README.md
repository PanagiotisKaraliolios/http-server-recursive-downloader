### Recursive File Downloader

This project is a Python-based recursive file downloader that allows you to download all files from a given URL, including subdirectories. The downloader supports various features such as:

- **Resumable Downloads**: Automatically resumes interrupted downloads using HTTP Range requests.
- **Speed Limiting**: Allows optional download speed limiting.
- **Pause and Resume**: Supports manual pause and resume during the download process.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Implements exponential backoff for retrying failed downloads.
- **Progress Monitoring**: Uses `tqdm` to display download progress in a user-friendly manner.

### Features
- Provide the base URL as a command-line argument.
- Downloads files into `downloaded_files/` followed by the rest of the URL path structure.
- Handles edge cases such as incomplete downloads, broken connections, and retry logic for failed attempts.

### Usage
To run the downloader, use the command:
```
python main.py <base_url>
```

Example:
```
python main.py https://example.com/files/
```

This script is helpful for downloading a large number of files recursively from a web server while providing robust error handling and user control.
